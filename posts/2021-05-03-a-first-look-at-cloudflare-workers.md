A [Cloudflare Worker](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers/) is JavaScript you write that runs on Cloudflare's edge. A [Cloudflare Service Worker](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-unleashed/) is specifically a worker which handles HTTP traffic and is written against the Service Worker API. Cloudflare Workers derive their name from Web Workers, specifically Service Workers.

The [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) is a W3C standard API for scripts that run in the background in a web browser and intercept HTTP requests. Cloudflare Workers are written against the same standard API but run on Cloudflare's edge network instead of the browser.

## Install wrangler CLI

[`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) is an officially supported CLI tool for [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). It's a bit of a process to install.

### BONUS install method with Volta

[Alex Anderson](https://twitter.com/ralex1993) gave me the hot tip on [Volta.sh](https://volta.sh/) which took only three lines to setup. Try this and if it works skip ahead to the Create project section.

```bash
curl https://get.volta.sh | zsh
volta install node
npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
```

I recommend starting at the [Wrangler CLI Install/Update page on the Cloudflare Documentation site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update) to see if any of the options listed are already configured on your machine. Use Cargo if you can.

### Install wrangler with nvm (in an alternate universe where nvm is a functional piece of software)

The `wrangler` README suggests using `nvm`, and by "suggests" I mean they tell you a global install with `npm` literally won't work. I don't personally use `nvm` and didn't have it installed on my machine, so down the rabbit hole I went.

This lead me on a wandering journey in search of the specific incantations I needed to get my broken Genie to turn on and start granting wishes (I think I mixed a few metaphors there). *In theory*, you should be able to install `nvm` with `curl`, create a dot-file for your shell, and then include a script.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | zsh
touch .zshrc
```

Add to `.zshrc` file.

```
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

Then I should be able to install the current Node LTS and finally `wrangler`.

```bash
nvm install --lts
npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
```

Due to my own user error I couldn't get `nvm` to work at all for the previous installation steps, through absolutely no fault of Cloudflare's. What I mean is I couldn't even get to the point where I could try to install wrangler because I couldn't even get `nvm install` to install a version of Node to run in the first place.

My terminal would go haywire and melt down in some sort of infinite loop of never ending gibberish of random digital characters, which I guess *technically* falls under the definition of an [error message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_message). The README points to a list of [EIGHT potential troubleshooting steps](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#troubleshooting-on-macos), which is possibly a signal that too many troubles arise when using this codebase.

At the end of the list there was a link to what I am sure is an absolutely riveting [7 year old, 170 comment long issue](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/576) at which point I gave up on trying to use `nvm`. I ended up finding a workaround with [`HomeBrew`](https://brew.sh/), [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), and [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/) that took about a minute to install and configure.

Looking back at this blog post a few weeks after the fact I found I made an obvious mistake along the way by using `bash` in the very first command when I should have been using `zsh`.

### Install it for real this time

Hopefully other M1 users will find this easier. Sorry for shoehorning an `nvm` rant into a CF Workers article, but they started it.

```bash
brew install cloudflare-wrangler
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo install wrangler --target=x86_64-apple-darwin
```

### Check version number

```bash
wrangler --version
```

Output:

```
üë∑ ‚ú®  wrangler 1.16.1
```

## Create project

`wrangler generate` will scaffold a Cloudflare Workers project from a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template). You can view the finished code for this project [on my GitHub](https://github.com/ajcwebdev/ajcwebdev-workers).

```bash
wrangler generate ajcwebdev-workers
```

Output:

```
Creating project called `ajcwebdev-workers`
Done! New project created
/Users/ajcwebdev/projects/ajcwebdev-workers

You can find your zone_id in the right sidebar of a
zone's overview tab at https://dash.cloudflare.com

You can find your account_id in the right
sidebar of your account's Workers page

You will need to update the following fields in
the created wrangler.toml file before continuing:
- account_id
```

If you haven't already, make sure to [create a Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/). Go to your profile and then your [API tokens tab](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). Create a token with the Cloudflare Workers template.

![02-api-tokens](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x4rd45ul02kpd1rk5ld3.png)

Click "Create Token" to create a token.

![03-create-api-token](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/reedsh9s4z3nsj5kqr6c.png)

Click "Use template" next to Edit Cloudflare Workers to use Edit Cloudflare Workers template.

![04-create-token](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/co5ficwdni1e09eosnqh.png)

Leave the default permissions and add your account and zone resources.

![05-api-token-summary](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sj2s68a5t2o0zul1nprc.png)

Click "Create Token" to create the token and make sure to save it somewhere you can find it.

### Test your token

You can test your new token with the following `curl` command.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```

If your token is working you will receive a response like this.

```json
{
  "result":{
    "id":"1234",
    "status":"active"
  },
  "success":true,
  "errors":[],
  "messages":[{
    "code":10000,
    "message":"This API Token is valid and active",
    "type":null
  }]
}
```

### Add account_id to wrangler.toml

Copy your `account_id` from your Workers dashboard.

![06-account-id](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wx33uzdsnsajtwfzfbsp.png)

Open `wrangler.toml` and add your `account_id`.

```toml
name = "ajcwebdev-workers"
type = "javascript"

account_id = "c64"
workers_dev = true
route = ""
zone_id = ""
```

I have redacted my id and it is recommended you do not commit this information into your repo. The easy way to ensure you do not commit this information is by adding `wrangler.toml` to `.gitignore` and creating a `wrangler.toml.example` with a blank file.

### Configure keys with `wrangler config`

`wrangler config` is an interactive command that will authenticate Wrangler by prompting you for a Cloudflare API Token or Global API key. If you want to use the Global API Key it will promptly yell at you for making poor life decision.

```bash
wrangler config
```

Output:

```
To find your API Token, go to
dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
and create it using the "Edit
Cloudflare Workers" template.

Consider using `wrangler login`
which only requires your Cloudflare
username and password.

If you are trying to use your Global API Key
instead of an API Token (Not Recommended), run
`wrangler config --api-key`.

Enter API Token: 
```

Enter your API token.

```
Validating credentials...
Successfully configured.
You can find your configuration file at:
/Users/ajcwebdev/.wrangler/config/default.toml
```

If you run into issues with your keys you may be able to just use `wrangler login` instead. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

```bash
wrangler login
```

## Project files

### package.json

You may notice that we don't have any dev or build scripts. There aren't even any dependencies except the entirely useless prettier.

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "name": "ajcwebdev-workers",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A template for kick starting a Cloudflare Workers project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "format": "prettier --write '**/*.{js,css,json,md}'"
  },
  "author": "ajcwebdev <anthony@stepzen.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "prettier": "^1.18.2"
  }
}
```

This is because Cloudflare Workers run in the cloud, and as we all know, [the cloud is just someone else's computer](https://medium.com/@storjproject/there-is-no-cloud-it-s-just-someone-else-s-computer-6ecc37cdcfe5). To run this code we need to deploy it and execute it on Cloudflare's network.

### index.js

`index.js` is the content of the Workers script. The content will notify the user of your website that you nailed it.

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    handleRequest(event.request)
  )
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  return new Response('Nailed it', {
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'text/plain',
      'X-Awesomeness': '9000'
    },
  })
}
```

We don't add header `X-Awesomeness` because we need to, we add it because we can.

## Deploy with `wrangler publish`

`wrangler publish` publishes your Worker to Cloudflare.

```bash
wrangler publish
```

Output:

```
Basic JavaScript project found.
Skipping unnecessary build!
Successfully published your script to
https://ajcwebdev-workers.anthonycampolo.workers.dev
```

Open up your favorite API client and make a GET request to your endpoint.

![07-insomnia-request](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kjm39zouurqqedcfxz82.png)

You can also visit the endpoint with your browser of choice.

![08-browser-request](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6b503pfgqlau3bvn99xx.png)

Open up the Network tab to see how much more awesome your response headers are.
